        The techniques allow for composing an atmosphere with sun, multiple cloud layers, moon, bright stars, and Milky Way, into a holistic sky with unprecedented level of detail and diversity. 
        GPU generated, viewpoint-aligned billboards are used to render stars with approximated color, brightness, and scintillations. 
        A similar approach is used to synthesize the moon considering lunar phase, earthshine, shading, and lunar eclipses.",

        Sketchy rendering techniques allow us to map data, e.g., about uncertainty, imprecision, or vagueness, independently from mappings to other visual variables such as size, color, and height.
        To this end, we present a design space for sketchy rendering for 2.5D treemaps and corresponding implementation of a real-time sketchy rendering technique. 
        The results of three user studies carried out indicate that sketchiness is a promising candidate for an independent visual variable for 2.5D treemaps, in particular to map ordinal data with a small range such as data that qualifies map items, it shows no strong interference with other visual variables such as color and height due to the regular gestalt of blocks and, hence, allows us to extend the expressiveness of 2.5D treemaps.",
